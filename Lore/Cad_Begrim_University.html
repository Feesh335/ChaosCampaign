            In the northern regions of Taeghas and Avanil lies a mountain range known as the Mystic Mountains. Worshipped since ancient times, the mystic mountains were known
            for the way they painted the night sky with bands of energy with every color of the rainbow. As they travel further south, the Mystic Mountains branch off into two
            separate mountain ranges, with the western range known as the Sage's Path and the eastern range as the Witch's Trails. The Sage's Path is regarded as a holy site, and
            many wars have been fought over ownership before the Council of Taeghas created an uneasy peace by allowing all pilgrims passage to them. The Witch's Trails pass south
            through Brosengae and are considered to be cursed by many who have travelled through. At the splitting point of these mountains is a great waterfall known as Cad Begrim,
            through which water and life giving energies flow in equal measure. Worshipped since ancient times for its majesty and healing properties, it soon became a gathering
            point for ancient sages from all walks of life, who convened by the waters as an open forum. Considering the knowledge gained from conversing there to be a gift from the gods, these sages eventually formed a Council
            which served as a basis of government for the region, and agreed to embellish the falls with beautiful marble spires out of reverence. While the spires were briefly used
            as a government building in which foreign affairs would be conducted, the Council soon agreed that Cad Begrim was to be a place of learning, and should be treated as such. 
            This decision marked the first official day for what was now known as Cad Begrim University, which soon became a world renowned University for research into the arcane.
            Not long after the founding of the University, it was discovered that Cad Begrim was the meeting point of several of the world's ley lines, lending the falls their 
            fabled energies. Breakthroughs followed breakthroughs until Cad Begrim found itself as the de facto leader in arcane research in Tir Na Mor. Cad Begrim maintains a somewhat
            friendly rivalry with Fordock University, with an incessant debate over which University is older due to the sages not officiating Cad Begrim until after Fordock's founding.
            The students of Cad Begrim insist that the University's knowledge of the arcane puts them at edge over their rival school.</p>
